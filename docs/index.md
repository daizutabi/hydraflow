<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ðŸš€ **Define and Run Experiments**
  Combine Hydra's configuration management with MLflow's experiment
  tracking to build powerful experimentation pipelines
- ðŸ“Š **Collect and Analyze Results**
  Gather, filter, and analyze experiment results with type-safe APIs
  for comprehensive insights
- ðŸ”„ **Automate Workflows**
  Automate complex experimental pipelines and manage large-scale
  machine learning projects efficiently

## What is HydraFlow?

HydraFlow seamlessly integrates [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) and
[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to create a comprehensive machine learning
experiment management framework. It provides a complete workflow from defining
experiments to execution and analysis, streamlining machine learning projects
from research to production.

- **Type-safe Configuration**: Leverage Python dataclasses for type-safe
  experiment configuration
- **Automatic Experiment Tracking**: Log configurations, metrics, and
  artifacts automatically
- **Powerful Result Analysis**: Advanced filtering and grouping of experimental
  results
- **Reproducibility**: Store experiments in a fully reproducible format
- **Pipeline Automation**: Build and execute complex experiment pipelines

## Quick Installation

```bash
pip install hydraflow
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.12+

## Documentation Structure

The HydraFlow documentation is organized into three main parts:
