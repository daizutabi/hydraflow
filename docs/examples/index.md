# HydraFlow Examples

This section provides practical examples of using HydraFlow for various
machine learning workflows. These examples demonstrate common patterns
and best practices for effective experiment management.

## Available Examples

### [Simple Example](simple-example.md)

The simple example demonstrates the basic usage of HydraFlow for training
a machine learning model. It covers:

- Setting up a HydraFlow application
- Defining configuration using dataclasses
- Running the application with different parameters
- Accessing and analyzing experiment results

This is an ideal starting point for those new to HydraFlow.

### [Analysis Example](analysis-example.md)

The analysis example focuses on using HydraFlow's analysis tools to
work with experiment results:

- Loading and filtering experiment runs
- Grouping runs by parameter values
- Converting results to DataFrames for analysis
- Creating visualizations to compare experiment outcomes

This example is useful for those looking to analyze existing experiments.

### [Advanced Example](advanced-example.md)

The advanced example demonstrates more sophisticated features of HydraFlow:

- Creating automated experiment workflows
- Defining job dependencies
- Implementing custom implementation classes
- Scaling experiments with parallel execution

This example is designed for users with more complex experiment needs.
