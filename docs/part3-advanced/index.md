# Advanced Multi-Run Workflows

HydraFlow extends Hydra's capabilities with advanced features for efficient
multi-run workflows. While Hydra provides basic parameter sweeping, HydraFlow
offers tools for more complex scenarios, including extended sweep syntax,
job definitions, and cluster submission.

## Overview

Part 3 focuses on HydraFlow's advanced features for efficient multi-run execution:

- **Extended Sweep Syntax** - Define complex parameter spaces with numerical
  ranges, combinations, and engineering notation

- **Job Configuration** - Create reusable job definitions with GitHub
  Actions-like syntax

- **Batch Submission** - Submit multiple runs efficiently to clusters
  and job schedulers

These capabilities help you manage complex machine learning experiments
at scale, making it easier to explore large parameter spaces and run
on distributed computing resources.

## Key Components

HydraFlow's advanced workflow capabilities are built around these components:

1. **Parser** - A powerful syntax parser for complex parameter sweeps,
   supporting ranges, lists, and combinations

2. **Job Definition** - YAML-based configuration for defining reusable
   multi-step jobs

3. **CLI Commands** - Commands for managing and executing jobs defined
   in configuration files

## Basic Workflow

```python
# 1. Define a job in .hydraflow.yaml
jobs:
  train:
    run: python train.py
    steps:
      - batch: >-
          model=transformer,lstm
          learning_rate=0.1:0.01:0.001
          optimizer=adam,sgd

# 2. Run the job using the CLI
$ hydraflow run train

# 3. Or submit the job to a cluster
$ hydraflow run train --submit
```

## When to Use Advanced Workflows

Consider using HydraFlow's advanced workflow features when:

- You need to explore complex parameter spaces with many configurations
- Your experiments require a structured approach with multiple steps
- You want to leverage distributed computing resources
- You need reproducible workflow definitions
