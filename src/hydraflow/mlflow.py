"""
This module provides functionality to log parameters from Hydra configuration objects
and set up experiments using MLflow. It includes methods for managing experiments,
searching for runs, and logging parameters and artifacts.

Key Features:
- **Experiment Management**: Set and manage MLflow experiments with customizable names
  based on Hydra configuration.
- **Run Logging**: Log parameters and metrics from Hydra configuration objects to
  MLflow, ensuring that all relevant information is captured during experiments.
- **Run Search**: Search for runs based on various criteria, allowing for flexible
  retrieval of experiment results.
- **Artifact Management**: Retrieve and log artifacts associated with runs, facilitating
  easy access to outputs generated during experiments.

This module is designed to integrate seamlessly with Hydra, providing a robust
solution for tracking machine learning experiments and their associated metadata.

    Note:
        The returned runs are sorted by their start time in ascending order.

        experiment_ids (list[str] | None): List of experiment IDs. Search can
            work with experiment IDs or experiment names, but not both in the

            or ``ALL`` runs defined in :py:class:`mlflow.entities.ViewType`.
        max_results (int): The maximum number of runs to put in the dataframe.
            Default is 100,000 to avoid causing out-of-memory issues on the user's
            machine.
        order_by (list[str] | None): List of columns to order by (e.g.,
            "metrics.rmse"). The ``order_by`` column can contain an optional
            ``DESC`` or ``ASC`` value. The default is ``ASC``. The default
            ordering is to sort by ``start_time DESC``, then ``run_id``.

            can work with experiment IDs or experiment names, but not both in
